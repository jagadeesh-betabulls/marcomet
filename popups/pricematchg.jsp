<p class="bodyblack">  Each week our staff personally scours the industry and calls various companies across the US to find the lowest prices available so we can pass the savings along to you. </p>

<p class="bodyblack">We are so confident that our prices are the lowest, that if you should happen to find a lower price with a different supplier, we either match that price or give you a 10% credit off your next item purchase (not to exceed $100 credit and not combinable with other offers).</p>

<p class="subtitle">What is the delivered price? </p>

<p class="bodyblack">The delivered price of an item or order is the entire cost to you of the identical merchandise, currently available, delivered to your property (anywhere in the US) using an identical shipping method, and any applicable tax collected by the supplier. The value of any do-it-yourself components of your comparative order will be added to your price to make an apples-to-apples comparison to our full service price.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What is identical merchandise? </p>

<p class="bodyblack">Our guarantee applies only to identical merchandise. This means the merchandise must be identical in quality, paper stock, ink coverage, number of colors, etc. and in accordance with brand standards..</p>

<p class="subtitle">Our guarantee does not extend to the following special purchase situations:</p>

  <ul><li>Competing offers on items that are no longer current or for merchandise that is no longer available. </li><li>   

    Competing offers on discontinued items, closeouts, demos, or items out of the box (even from authorized dealers). </li><li>   

    Competing offers mentioned to you only verbally, whether in person or on the phone. </li><li>   

    Competing offers advertised only within an individual store (such as on an in-store sign or price tag).  

  </li></ul>

<p class="subtitle">What evidence is required? </p>

<p class="bodyblack">We will need evidence of the competing offer sufficient to verify that the offer meets the criteria outlined above. This varies from circumstance to circumstance but generally a formal quotation with all specifications must be submitted for comparison purposes.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How do you get us to match or beat another price? </p>

<p class="bodyblack">To present a valid competing offer for our review, you may notify us when placing your order by indicating that you have a competing price in the comments section, and/or if your competing quote is available in electronic form, you can upload it at the time of your order. Otherwise, please just give us a call toll-free at:</p>

<p class="bodyblack">888-777-9832, or simply drop us an email at <a href="mailto:marketingscvs@marcomet.com">marketingscvs@marcomet.com</a> and we will contact you.</p></td></tr></table>
