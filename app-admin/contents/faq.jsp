  <p>Of course! As most businesspeople these days have learned about the web, 
    it should be applied where it improves service and not as a substitute where 
    direct verbal communication is required. When you use our web system, you 
    will see how it compliments your communication with your vendor by keeping 
    you both &quot;on the same page&quot; regarding the requirements and progress 
    of your work. It's like having direct access to your vendor's order management 
    system and vice versa - the big boys have been doing this kind of supply chain 
    integration successfully for years, we're making it available to the rest 
    of us. </p>

  <p>Simple, just call your vendor

    will determine what's best for you. Then you can place your order on the web, 
    or your vendor can even do it for you! </p>

  <p>Every vendor sets their own prices, 
    but probably not. MarComet charges a nominal transaction fee that covers things 
    like credit card processing, accounting, web hosting, marketing, etc., all 
    things that the vendor would have had to pay for and build into their cost 
    anyway.</p>

  <p><b><a name="How does MarComet's escrow service help me?">How 
    does MarComet's escrow service help me?</a></b> </p>
  <p>MarComet has provided its escrow 
    service in response to an age-old problem in buying and selling services. 
    A buyer typically does not want to pay for services that haven't yet been 
    performed. Otherwise what are they to do if the services are not appropriately 
    delivered? On the other hand, a quality vendor desires payment up front to 
    ensure it gets paid for the custom services it is about to perform, they can't 
    exactly &quot;put their services back on the store shelf&quot; if a buyer 
    changes their mind about buying them. Therefore, MarComet acts as an intermediary 
    between the two parties, so both are protected. Click <u>here</u> to read 
    more about MarComet's escrow policy </p>-->

  <p>Firstly, you select the item or items on the website that you are interested 
    in buying. You will then be brought into your vendor's catalog for that service 
    where you can make choices, compare prices, provide your job specifications 
    and generate an order.You may be asked to provide payment of a deposit amount prior to commencement of work.
    <!--that will be held in escrow by us. We do not release payment o your

  <p>How does the process work after 
    I've ordered?&nbsp; Your order will be forwarded to your vendor, who will 
    then contact as needed before starting the work. If your vendor, requires 
    or recommends changes be made to your order, they will contact you accordingly. 
    If the service requires that you 
    be presented with materials for your review (&quot;comps&quot; or &quot;proofs&quot;), 
    these will either be posted on the system or physically sent for your review 
    and approval.</p>
  <p> All your approvals are noted on the system so that work can continue or 
    be finally delivered.You and your vendor will be kept on top of your project 
    every step of the way by receiving e-mail whenever you are needed to review 
    something on the website. When your job is done, it will be re-tabulated to 
    include any change orders you've approved and/or shipping and any balance 
    due will be charged or credited.
    <!-- via your original means of deposit payment and added or subtracted 
    from your escrow balance.We will then attempt to confirm the delivery of your

  <p><b><a name="How accurate is online proofing?">How 
    accurate is online proofing?</a></b> </p>
  <p>Online proofing is an acceptable 
    means for reviewing many levels of work including: creative concepts, design 
    layout, copy and many types of print jobs. Due to inconsistencies with the 
    presentation of color via individual computer monitors and printers, these 
    presentations are accurate only within bounds. Large print jobs should always 
    be proofed by a hard copy matchprint. </p>

  <p>By indicating all of your work 
    approvals on the system, it enables us to eliminate the confusion that sometimes
