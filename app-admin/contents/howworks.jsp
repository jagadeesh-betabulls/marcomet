<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The host of this site is offering their services 
  utilizing a state-of-the-art purchasing and provisioning management system provided 
  by MarComet, Inc. Following is a brief explanation of how the system works.&nbsp; 
  Since this is a &quot;live&quot; system, the best way to see it work is to actually 
  order something.&nbsp; However, if you would like a more detailed personal demonstration 
  of the system please feel free to contact us to arrange for a representative 
  to bring you through the system, one-on-one.</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">If 
  you use can read e-mail and use a web browser like Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
  you are going to love our method of interacting with your vendor!</font></p>
<ul>

      a day 7 days a week, no scheduling of appointments and traveling that interrupt 
      you from your regular work schedule.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It leverages the power of one 
      of the simplest and most accepted means of communicating today - e-mail!</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It let's you order or monitor 
      your projects from virtually anywhere via the web! Your home, your office, 
      or on the road!</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our catalog system makes buying 
      easy! You can see your buying options, compare prices, and get our expert 
      advice. You'll be asked everything needed to know to get the job done right. 
      And if you need help, your vendor is a phone call away!</font></p>
  </li>
  <!--<li> 
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You receive the protection 
      of MarComet's escrow services. We don't pay your vendor until the work is 
      fully performed.</font></p>
  </li>-->
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Step one</b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Firstly, you select the item or items on the website 
  that you are interested in buying. You will then be brought into your vendor's 
  catalog for that service where you can make choices, compare prices, provide 
  your job specifications and generate an order. You may be asked to provide payment 
  of a deposit amount. 
  <!-- that will be held in escrow by MarComet. We do not release 
  payment to your vendor until the work is completed.-->
  &nbsp; An e-mail notifying your vendor that you have ordered materials gets 
  sent to them immediately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Step Two</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your order is posted on the system 
  in your account and also forwarded to your vendor, who will then contact you 
  as needed before starting the work. If your vendor, requires or recommends changes 
  be made to your order, they will contact you accordingly.&nbsp; Most of the 
  time, you will receive an email notification linking you to the appropriate 
  place in the system to alert you of any changes or confirmations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Step Three</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the service requires that you be presented with 
  materials for your review (i.e. design sample &quot;comps&quot; or print &quot;proofs&quot;), 
  these will either be posted on the system or physically sent for your review 
  and approval. All your approvals are noted on the system and you are e-mailed 
  when you need to review or approve materials so that work can continue.&nbsp; 
  This process continues until you're satisfied with the work and it is ready 
  for final delivery.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">You and your vendor will 
  be kept on top of your project every step of the way by receiving e-mail whenever 
  you are needed to review something on the website. Of course you can contact 
  your vendor directly for any customer service issues or questions. You can use 
  the &quot;e-mail Vendor&quot; option in the website to generate an e-mail to 
  your vendor that will be logged and managed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Step Four</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When your job is done, it will be re-tabulated to 
    include any change orders you've approved and/or shipping and any balance 
    due will be charged or credited.<!--When your job is done, it will 
  be re-tabulated to include any change orders you've approved and any balance 
  due will be charged or credited via your original means of deposit payment and 
  added or subtracted from your escrow balance. We will then confirm the delivery 
  of your order and unless you're notified us of a problem, your escrow funds 
  will be released and your vendor will be paid. Click here for a detailed explanation 
  of our <a href="terms_page_1.htm"> terms and conditions.</a>--></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Lastly</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All your graphic and work files reside in your 
  account on the system for easy access when other work is to be performed.&nbsp; 
  I.E. - you need a new brochure and the design vendor needs an .eps file of your 
  logo.&nbsp; You can either go into your account and email him the file or he 
  can log in an get it himself. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">As more and 
  more vendors, designers and printers join the network and set-up their own sites 
  and services the more flexibility you will have in getting your work performed 
  by true professionals.&nbsp; <b><i>Best of all, your login and password will 
  work and bring up your account on ANY MarComet hosted website and system.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The MarComet System makes it 
  easy to work with others!</b></font></p>
<!--<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MarComet has provided its escrow 
  service in response to an age-old problem in buying and selling services. A 
  buyer typically does not want to pay for services that haven't yet been performed. 
  Otherwise what are they to do if the services are not appropriately delivered? 
  On the other hand, a quality vendor desires payment up front to ensure it gets 
  paid for the custom services it is about to perform, they can't exactly &quot;put 
  their services back on the store shelf&quot; if a buyer changes their mind about 
  buying them. Therefore, MarComet acts as an intermediary between the two parties, 
  so both are protected. Click <u>here</u> to read more about MarComet's escrow 
  policy.</font></p>-->
