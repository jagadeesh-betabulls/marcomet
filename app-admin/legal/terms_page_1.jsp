        provided herein and the fact that a party seeks or opposes such provisional 
        relief shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to arbitrate. The

        findings of fact and conclusions of law. The award shall separately identify 
        the remedy awarded, and, for any damages awarded, the calculation supporting 
        any such damages. The parties waive the right to seek or receive any form 
        of punitive damages or appeal the Arbitration. The statute of limitations 
        and doctrines of laches, estoppel and the like which would apply to a 
        lawsuit will apply in Arbitration. The substantially prevailing party 
        shall be entitled to recover reasonable fees of attorneys. The parties 
        to the Arbitration shall keep the Arbitration process and documents disclosed 
        there under confidential. BY USING MARCOMET SERVICES YOU ARE GIVING UP 
        THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RESOLUTION IN COURT IN CASE OF A DISPUTE.

        All parties to the Arbitration hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction

        Period).&nbsp; Buyer agrees to utilize the mechanism for communicating 
        acceptance as provided within the website.</p>
      <p class="bodyBlack"><b>Buyer Non-Acceptance and Dispute Resolution:&nbsp;</b> 
        A Buyer indicating their specific non-acceptance of Final Delivered Work 
        Product within the proscribed Acceptance Period shall be required to provide 
        documentation to support their non-acceptance.&nbsp; MarComet may additionally 
        seek documentation from the Seller supporting their contention of Final 
        Delivery.&nbsp; Based upon any evaluation MarComet may perform of the 
        job specifications ordered and the Work Product delivered, MarComet will 
        release the escrowed funds in whole, less transaction fees, to either 
        party as it sees fit in its sole discretion or may hold the escrowed funds 
        until such time as a resolution has been determined through arbitration.&nbsp; 
        MarComet makes no guarantees as to the evaluation, its extensiveness, 
        or its accuracy.&nbsp; Buyer and Seller agree that MarComet shall not 
        be liable to either party in any case, and that any continuation of the 
        dispute must be handled directly between the two parties independently 
        of MarComet.</p>
      <p class="bodyBlack"><b>Lack of Acceptance Acknowledgement:&nbsp;</b> Buyer 
        agrees that it is their responsibility to acknowledge their acceptance 
        or non-acceptance of Work Product within the Acceptance Period.&nbsp; 
        Buyer agrees that should it not contact MarComet with an explicit indication 
        of non-acceptance utilizing the proscribed method of notification, MarComet 
        shall release the escrow funds as if the Work Product was accepted by 
        the Buyer.&nbsp; Buyer agrees to release MarComet from further liability 
        beyond that time.</p>-->
