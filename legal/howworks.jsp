  has provided its escrow service in response to an age-old problem in buying
  and selling services. A buyer typically does not want to pay for services that
  haven't yet been performed. Otherwise what are they to do if the services are
  not appropriately delivered? On the other hand, a quality vendor desires
  payment up front to ensure it gets paid for the custom services it is about to
  perform, they can't exactly &quot;put their services back on the store
  shelf&quot; if a buyer changes their mind about buying them. Therefore,
  MarComet acts as an intermediary between the two parties, so both are
  protected. Click <u>here</u> to read more about MarComet's escrow policy</font></p>
